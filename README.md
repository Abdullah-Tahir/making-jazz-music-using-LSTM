# making-jazz-music-using-LSTM

As a passionate machine learning enthusiast, I have demonstrated my creativity and proficiency by generating my own jazz music using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. Utilizing the flexible Functional API, I designed a complex model capable of generating highly sophisticated jazz music.

Through collecting and preprocessing a dataset of jazz MIDI files and converting them into a suitable format for LSTM training, I was able to optimize and train the model. The LSTM generated sequences of notes and chords, and I used my expertise to evaluate and fine-tune the output music for pitch accuracy and style consistency.

My work in making jazz music using LSTM highlights my ability to innovate with machine learning, while showcasing my passion for music and artistic expression. It exemplifies my proficiency in data preprocessing, model architecture design, and deep learning optimization, all skills that are highly valuable in today's competitive job market.
